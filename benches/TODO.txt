this lib does minimal heavy work (CRC would be the "worst") so I don't expect execution speed benchmarks to show much
They get even less interesting when you realise that the large  waits in the modbus spec  make speed pretty much a non-issue

What I do want to at some point is track memory usage. This lib is targeted at embedded applications so FLASH and stack usage are both of some importance
